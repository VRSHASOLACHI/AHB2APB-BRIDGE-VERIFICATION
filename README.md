# AHB2APB-BRIDGE-VERIFICATION
This project focuses on the functional verification of an AHB to APB bridge using a SystemVerilog UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)–based environment. The AHB2APB bridge acts as a protocol converter between the high-performance AHB bus, typically used by processors, and the low-power APB bus.
